== Description ==

Cubicast is an affordable session recording service with some unique features built-in. Increase productivity for support agents, testers, and web developers. Track JavaScript errors, rage clicks, server performance bottlenecks, pinpoint bugs, and show solutions. **To utilize Cubicast, you need an active subscription plan after your expired 15-day trial period**.

### How is your website performing around the globe?
Keep track of slow resources, including slow-loading pages, API endpoints, scripts, images, and CSS resources with customizable thresholds.

### Media capturing
Does your website make use of canvas elements or videos? Cubicast is your best bet if you need to capture these media elements.

### Advanced search
Quickly locate what matters. Full-text searching in workspaces, including sessions, visitors, and events. Example use cases:

1. Get all JavaScript errors that occurred in the last two days. Further, if you type `not defined` in the search term, you will get all JavaScript errors related to undefined variables. See which of your users are affected.
2. List all input events that the users typed a specific term or selected a particular value in form elements.
3. Get all identified users from a specific country that visited your site the last week.
4. Locate all of the recordings created last week that have issues in general, whether this is JavaScript errors or slow-loading resources.
5. Get all clicks tracked on a specific page by including any terms of the page URL. For example, if you want to get all clicks on a webpage having a URL of `http://example.com/downloads`, select `Clicks` as the event type and type `downloads` in the search term.

### Slack and Zendesk integrations
Cubicast integrates with Slack. Get real-time notifications on your preferred Slack channel about any activity in a workspace.
Accept customer support requests to your Zendesk account. See what your users witnessed and their issues **before** asking for support.

### Post-processing
Capture any website using our Chrome and Firefox browser extensions. Add bookmarks and sticky rich-text annotations. Embed the annotated recordings to your website. Export recordings as native video or animated GIFs using our Chrome extension. Create video walkthroughs with minimum effort.

### Crystal clear pricing
Pricing is adjusted based on features and usage (API requests). Whether an individual or an enterprise, there is a proper plan for you. All plans come with a full-featured 15-day trial. No credit card is required.
